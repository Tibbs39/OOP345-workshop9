# Workshop 09 - Smart Pointers

In this workshop, we backup an encrypted text file of characters to a binary file, restore the encrypted data from the binary file and add multi-threading to the solution.

w9.cpp and SecureData.h was provided to us by our professor to test our code
SecureData.cpp was provided to us partially implemented.
We had to implement the writing and reading to a binary file, and add multi-threading to the encoding portion of the solution.

This small program requires 3 arguments. 
1. The original text file, in this repository, it is w9_text.dat.
2. The output file name.
3. The key to be used for encoding and decoding.

Example:
```./ws w9_text.dat w9_encoded.dat C```

These workshops are course work from OOP345 Fall 2018 at Seneca College.
